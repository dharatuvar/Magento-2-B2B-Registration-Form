# Magento 2 B2B Registration Form

[***Magento 2 B2B Registration Form***](https://meetanshi.com/magento-2-b2b-registration-form.html) by Meetanshi offers a separate registration form for B2B customers and wholesalers.

The default Magento 2 sign up form falls short when it comes to dealing with the wholesalers or B2B registration. To overcome this limitation, Meetanshi has developed Magento 2 B2B Registration Form extension.

For the Magento 2 stores having B2B and B2C registrations, it is difficult to manage them at a time. Having a separate registration form for B2B accounts with additional fields like company name, VAT or TAX number, business type, etc. makes it easier.

With Magento 2 B2B Registration Form module, the admin is notified when a new B2B sign up is performed. Admin has to approve the registration and the customer is notified of the same via an Email or frontend message.

Simplify the B2B registration in the Magento 2 stores now!
